# Transformer architectures for audio

Include:

* Wav2Vec2
* Hubert + DistilHubert
* JukeBox
* XLSR-Wav2Vec2


Now that we've seen how to use pipelines for audio tasks, it's time to get our hands dirty and train our own models! In the next section, we'll see how to fine-tune a pretrained audio model to classify different genres of music!
